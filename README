paulsdice.py is a python script that simulates various dice rolling

Example usage: 

2d20 -- rolls 2 d20s, shows each roll and the total. 
    You can change these numbers.
    Omitting the number before the d defaults to 1.

7k4  -- rolls 7 d10s, shows the individual rolls, then sorts them and keeps the top 4.
    It also takes care of "Exploding Dice"

test d6 -- you can also do test d10, test 2d6, or change those numbers as you wish. 
    This command rolls the dice many times and shows how many 1s, 2s, 3s, etc. came up.

h or help -- displays the help menu

q or quit or exit -- exits the program
